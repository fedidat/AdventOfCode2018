# Advent of Code 2018

This repo contains my solutions to Advent of Code 2018.

This year, I started solving the problems using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

By day 10, I felt comfortable in Python and moved to solve the rest of the problems in Golang.

After day 14, after some back and forth, I'm done with Golang for now. Sorry Rob Pike,
I guess I'm not "brilliant" enough. Or maaaybe this language is way less
appropriate then even Java for scripting. Back to `jupyter-lab`.

See you on the other end!
