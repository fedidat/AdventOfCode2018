# Advent of Code 2018

This repo contains my solutions to Advent of Code 2018.

This year, I started solving the problems using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

By day 10, I felt comfortable in Python and moved to solve the rest of the problems in Golang.

I plan on moving back to Python for more practice later on if I feel good in Go.

See you on the other end!
