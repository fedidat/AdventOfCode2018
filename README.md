# Advent of Code 2018

This repo contains my solutions to Advent of Code 2018.

This year, I used the contest to learn new languages. I started solving the problems using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

By day 10, I felt comfortable in Python and moved to solve the rest of the problems in Golang.

After day 14, after some back and forth, I was done with Golang. It feels like a huge step back and takes the minimalismm and opinionation too far for me. I might use it for more relevant projects in the future.

I only really had problems with days 15 and 24, which were far too long and tedious.

Well, that was fun!
